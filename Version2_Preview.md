# Version 2.0 ‚Äì Study Sprint Co-Pilot

**Target Release:** Q4 2025  
**Repository Branch:** `v2.0-scope`  

---

## 1. Vision & Goals

In v2.0 we evolve Study Sprint Co-Pilot from a single-user focus timer into a lightweight, social, and deeply customizable productivity companion‚Äîwhile preserving the minimal, distraction-free core.  

- **Enhance Focus** with inline task management, quick-extend controls, and pre-break warnings.  
- **Automate & Schedule** timers by calendar integration so sessions start on your chosen cadence.  
- **Deepen Engagement** via home-screen widgets, simple analytics, and optional co-study rooms.  
- **Polish UI/UX** with progressive disclosure, subtle animations, and theme support.  
- **Maintain Minimalism**: every new feature is opt-in, tucked away until needed, and toggleable in Settings.

## 5. User Stories

- **As a student**, I want to attach a checklist to my sprint so I can tick off tasks as I go.  
- **As a professional**, I need to extend my focus by 5 minutes without navigating menus.  
- **As a planner**, I‚Äôd like my app to remind me to start sessions at scheduled times.  
- **As a power user**, I want a home-screen widget to launch my Daily Deep Work preset in one tap.  
- **As a remote study group**, we want synchronized sprints so we can keep each other accountable.

## 6. Technical Considerations

- **Data Model**: Extend `FocusTime` to include `[TaskItem]` and `[ScheduleEntry]`.  
- **Notifications**: Add new category/actions for ‚ÄúExtend‚Äù & ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù and pre-break triggers.  
- **Widgets**: Use WidgetKit with `TimelineProvider` for live updates every second/minute.  
- **Networking**: Co-study via MultipeerConnectivity or lightweight WebSocket server.  
- **Persistence**: Migrate `FocusTimeStore` to support tasks, schedules, and theme preferences.  
- **Permissions**: Request Calendar access (for Event sync) and HealthKit if enabled.

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Design Workshop**: Create Figma mockups for Task Panel, Scheduler UI, and Widgets.  
2. **Prototype Key Flows**: Build a SwiftUI proof-of-concept for inline tasks and calendar scheduling.  
3. **User Validation**: Conduct a small-batch beta test to refine feature scope and UI friction points.  
4. **Development Kickoff**: Merge `v2.0-scope` branch, set up feature flags, and begin Sprint 1.
